With our login page, we kept it simple and familiar with users being able to type in their account email and password to then login into our app. They can Either log in normally and start doing what they need to do with our app or create an account to start using the app.

When users decide to make an account they are prompted to give the required information to start using the app. They can either cancel and be taken back to the sign-up page, just in case they accidentally hit register, or if they filled out the required information they can hit register and be taken to the home page.

Once a user is on the home page they have a variety of functions and widgets available to them. They have a search bar to look for a person or group that exists within the app. Users have a calender that displays any upcoming payments in the future if they already belong to a group. The notification button sits on top to notify the user when someone invites them to a split group, someone leaves a group, etc.

In the group tab, Users can see all the groups they currently belong to which gives them the option to leave one, edit one if permitted, or create a new group for a user's new spilt payment.

A user can click on a group so they can see the details of who is part of that group, what is the pool of money, how the money is split if they want to kick a member out as well as seeing how much each member is paying, and add members function to add more people to the group, an edit button which opens up a new page to can thing about the group and of course a back button so a user can go back to the previous group page.

If a user decides to make a new group they are given a set of parameters to fill out. The pool of money that is needed for rent, food, or even a Netflix payment. It also has the potion if a user wants to spilt things evenly among members or have it distributed by percentages. The user can also add people right on the create group page. This can be accessed by pressing the create a group button or when you are checking out an already existing group you can hit the edit button to bring up this page.

The notification button is there to tell a user that someone is inviting them to a group, or someone is leaving/ been kicked from a group if someone changed a setting users can agree or disagree with that change, etc. This will be a way for a user to see everything that is happening within their groups

The account is there so people can manage their method of payment or if they want to change any info about their account they can have that ability inside that account tab. It also gives you the option to have push notifications or not so a user can have some accessibility in the app. Of course, there is a logout button so if a user wants to use another account for whatever reason they can.
