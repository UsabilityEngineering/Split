# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

# Executive Summary
This application's goal is to make it **easier and more convinient for people who split monthly bills or payments.** People with roommates or even sometimes siblings share the costs for things like rent, utility bills, or streaming service subscriptions. In this requirements gathering phase, we explored our major target audience, colleges students, and what kind of issues and desires they might have regarding this problem space.

We surveyed and interviewed college students to understand their preferences and concerns

* 32.3% of participants forget about payments people owe them.
* 77.4% of participants are already comfortable/satisfied with other finanical apps like Venmo
* 80.6% agreed that auto payments make their lives easier
* 35.5% stated they are strongly concerned with sharing bank/payment information within an app

We interviewed college students to understand the specifics between their monthly shared bills
* 100% stated that they share the cost of utility bills with roommates and the compensation of their portions is done through Venmo
* 50% stated that they share a video streaming service subscription with someone else which their share the cost for
* 100% stated that they often forget about payments that others have not made to them and would have liked for them to be reminded without confrontation

From the requirements gathering, we identified common user needs
* Users want a way to be notified/reminded of pending payments that people have not compensated them for
* Users are neither comfortable nor uncomfortable with confronting others for payments that are owed to them, so this app idea in general would solve the problem space for those that find it uncomfortable.
* Security and data privacy is a big concern so that should be a big focus in the development of this app
